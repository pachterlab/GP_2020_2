# G_ExtNois_Aug2020
Supporting simulation and statistics algorithms for the intrinsic/extrinsic noise mini-project.

The repository contains files that can be used to reproduce the manuscript's figure. See `fig_generator_python.ipynb` for the Python version, executable in Google Colaboratory, and `fig_generator.m` for the MATLAB version. The Python simulation logic is provided in `ext_noise_gill.py`. The MATLAB simulation logic is provided in `gillespie_burst.m` and `gillespie_gamma_K.m`.
